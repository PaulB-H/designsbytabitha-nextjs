      <h1>About Tabitha</h1>
      <p>
        With a rich background spanning over 15 years in IT project management
        within the banking sector, Tabitha made the bold decision to follow her
        true passion for colour and design. She left the structured world of
        technology, to embrace a journey of creativity and self-expression.

      <p>
        Enrolling in an interior decorating course at George Brown, Tabitha
        mastered the principles of design and colour, which laid the foundation
        for her various creative pursuits. Starting with Interior Design, she
        specialized in kitchen and bathroom renovations where she combined
        aesthetic flair with meticulous project management to create functional
        but beautiful spaces that delighted her clients.

        In her spare time she continued to hone her sewing and garment making
        skills and discovered her passion for cake decorating. In recent years,
        Tabitha has been focused on mastering the art of painting, using her
        understanding of design and colour to bring scenes to life on canvas.
        For Tabitha, creativity knows no bounds, whether it's orchestrating the
        perfect room transformation, sewing a new garment, painting vibrant
        landscapes, or crafting delectable confections, she finds fulfillment in
        the boundless realms of creativity.
